      "Financial Recommendations:\n",
      "1. Increase Emergency Savings: Based on your transaction history, it looks like your monthly expenses vary significantly. It is important to have at least 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved up in an emergency fund. Aim to save an additional $5,000 per month towards building up this fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Reduce Discretionary Spending: Your lifestyle choices seem to be on the higher side, which may be contributing to your high debt level. Consider cutting back on non-essential expenses such as dining out, shopping, and entertainment. Try to save at least $1,000 per month by reducing discretionary spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Pay Down High-Interest Debt: Since your debt level is high, focus on paying off high-interest debts such as credit card balances or personal loans. Allocate an extra $2,000 per month towards paying down these debts to reduce the overall interest costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Increase Retirement Savings: As a middle-income earner, it's important to prioritize saving for retirement. Aim to contribute at least 10-15% of your income towards retirement accounts such as a 401(k) or IRA. Consider increasing your monthly contributions by $1,500 to secure your financial future.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Invest in Education Savings for Children: With two children, it's essential to start saving for their education expenses early on. Consider opening a 529 college savings plan and contribute $500 per month per child to ensure they have funds for higher education in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Review Insurance Policies: Make sure you have adequate insurance coverage for health, life, and property. Consider reviewing your policies to ensure you're not overpaying for coverage you don't need. Look for potential savings of $200 per month by optimizing your insurance plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these personalized financial recommendations, you can improve your financial situation, build wealth for the future, and secure a stable financial foundation for you and your family. If you have any specific financial goals or concerns, feel free to share them for further tailored advice.\n"

By following these steps, you can improve your overall financial health and work towards achieving your long-term financial goals.
